		<h4 class="title">Background</h4>
		<p>Betkong is an international esports bet exchange that's currently under development. I was approached to put together early UI and UX concepts for Betkong in Sketch.</p>

		<p>Good design helps a brand exude trustworthiness and put people at ease, which is especially important when <strong>a) breaking into a market</strong> and <strong>b) money is involved</strong>. My approach was to marry great design with familiar gaming elements and an information structure that users would be familiar with.</p>
